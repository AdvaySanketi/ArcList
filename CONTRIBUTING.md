# Contributing

Welcome to the project! I'm really excited to have you on board, and before we dive into the guidelines, let me share the essence of why this project was created.

## Intention behind building this project

At its core, this project embodies two important aims:

1. **Start Your Open Source Journey**: It's aimed to kickstart your open-source journey. Here, you'll learn the basics of Git and get a solid grip on the [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and I strongly believe that learning and building should go hand in hand.
2. **Diving into Go and HTMX**: This application will help you in your journey of understanding a client-server architecture. And I've planned much more cool stuff to add in the near future if the project hits more number of contributors.

I'd love for you to make the most of this project - it's all about learning, helping, and growing in the open-source world.
