# Contributing

Welcome to the project! I'm really excited to have you on board, and before we dive into the guidelines, let me share the essence of why this project was created.

## Intention behind building this project

At its core, this project embodies two important aims:

1. **Start Your Open Source Journey**: It's aimed to kickstart your open-source journey. Here, you'll learn the basics of Git and get a solid grip on the [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and I strongly believe that learning and building should go hand in hand.
2. **Diving into Go and HTMX**: This application will help you in your journey of understanding a client-server architecture. And I've planned much more cool stuff to add in the near future if the project hits more number of contributors.

I'd love for you to make the most of this project - it's all about learning, helping, and growing in the open-source world.

## Guidelines for Contributions

1. **Claiming an Issue**: Before you start working on an issue, make sure it's assigned to you. We do this to avoid overlapping efforts and to ensure your hard work doesn't go to waste. Please avoid raising a PR for an issue assigned to someone else.
2. **Commit Format**: When making commits, follow this format: `tag-#issue-number: <commit-message>`. The tag should be one of these: `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`.
3. **PR Title**: When creating a Pull Request, the title should be in this format: `tag-#issue-number: <Title-of-PR>`. Again, use the same tags: `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`.
4. **Selective Staging**: Make sure you stage only the necessary commits when raising a PR.
